<p>Experiential travel (or "immersion travel") is one of the major market trends in the modern tourism industry. It is an approach to travelling which focuses on experiencing a country, city or particular place by connecting to its history, people, food and culture.
The term “Experiential travel” is already mentioned in publications from 1985 – however it was discovered as a meaningful market trend much later.
